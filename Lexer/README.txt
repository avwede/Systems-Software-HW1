How to compile:
Run the makefile using `make` which runs gcc driver.c lex.c -lm.
Make sure the default driver.c file is in the same directory as the lex.c we turned in.

How to run:
For individual tests, run ./a.out <input file>

To run the testing script:
chmod +x tester.sh
./tester.sh

OR

bash tester.sh
